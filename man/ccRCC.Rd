\title{cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) dataset}
\format{A list of 10 VAF matrices}
\description{
Dataset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Zhang et al., 2014) from the multiregional sequencing variant allele frequency. The dataset contain 10 patients.

Dataset of cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) (Gerlinger et al. 2014) from the multiregional sequencing variant allele frequency. 
The data set contain 8 patients VAFs.

Dataset of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) (Gerlinger, et al. 2014) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Zhang et al., 2014), combined from the multiregional sequencing variant allele frequency. The dataset contain 18 patients.
